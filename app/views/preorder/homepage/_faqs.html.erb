          <summary>How do I change the CSS?</summary>
          <p>Head over to <code>app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss</code>. It makes it easy to change around the elements used throughout the HTML.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alternatively, you can dive right into the CSS, have a look at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/main.css.scss</code>.</p>

          <summary>Why did you release this?</summary>
          <p>Hardware startups are less welcome on Kickstarter than they were 6 months ago. We needed to roll our own kickstarter, so we did. Other hardware startups probably will too, so we made it easier for them by open sourcing our way of doing it.</p>

          <summary class=''>What software stack does this use?</summary>
          <p>It's a Ruby on Rails app that makes heavy use of SCSS, Kickstarter's wonderful <code>amazon_flex_pay</code> gem, and a hint of CoffeeScript.</p>
